How about this app so this doesn't really lecture started proper yet I guess. I don't know if anyone has been asking each other well for your Transformers. Don't worry about it if you don't know, we'll talk a little bit about them in this lecture on the next one. Uhm, apologies earlier. I think I said in the first year modules I thought you said it, that's not correct, does it? So I'm old and we did it in first year, so sorry about that. You get this year apparently. So this will all make sense hopefully then. I mentioned this app. Did anybody download it or look at it? Now, one person may be cool. I want to show you just something very quick which is tenuously linked to what we're going to talk about. But don't worry about this too much. Once we start the lecture. So in this app there's a spectrogram running it's assigned spectrogram. So this is time moving across and frequency on the Y axis. And you can think of this as lots of lane graphs, just one after the other. But color is telling you the intensity and you can maybe see it updating as I'm talking. If I can get this to resonate. Let's see what it looks like. So you're seeing the harmonics. From the wine glass. Very sharp, well defined frequencies. And if I go like that. You see a broad spectrum of frequencies. Just put your hand up if you think you understand why you see that behavior. And. OK nobody OK good, so I'm hoping. By the end of the next this election, some of the next one you have some idea what's going on here? What a furrier transform is is related to this. In fact, the phone is doing is. And what's called a discrete furrier transform. Off the sign data that's coming into it at the moment. OK. So then the lecture proper. Unless there's any questions about that or he's OK, alright, so today what I want to do is recap on what the debroy wavelength is from last year. Quantum mechanics is all about describing matter. Using so-called matter waves. But the mathematics and the physics of cotton McCarthy quantum mechanics is very similar. To that of studying waves, so we're going to talk about wave packets and plane waves and how you form those via superposition. I'll show you a little web app. That's used to kind of highlight. How that works to try and give you some intuition about it. I think this stuff can be difficult. Because it's difficult to get that intuition. But playing with these things. The apps apps on your phone and stuff that got there will help. And then that should lead us to the classical uncertainty relationship and talking about waves will be a very, very tenuous link to Penguins. Very tenuous, I'll mention it for like 5 seconds. But I wanted to get a picture of a big Penguin. Take that in the Google and that was the first link. I have no idea where it came from, but I think it's pretty cool. And this will be to do with beat waves. We'll see that when we get there. OK, so. Recap then about the Debroy wavelength. So it was Prince Louis Debroy. Who came up with this idea in 1924? So this is after bore and after Einstein. It was coincidentally 24 when he came up with the idea of real young Achiever did this as part of his PhD. My PhD thesis sitting in Queens library. I don't think it's removed since will end there. He won the Nobel Prize for his. And he was real philosopher, and as we'll see with quantum mechanics. People often consider the philosophy behind it. He thought Einstein showed that light can exhibit matter like. Behavior I click a particle. In nature there's often symmetries. So perhaps matter can exhibit wavelike behavior. And he summed this up with these two equations, and in this context. They're called the Einstein Debroy equations, so F = E / H and Lambda equals X / P, and he just said that there's some way of like behavior associated with matter. And those waves. Will have some frequency on some wavelength. Night. The wavelength. H over the momentum is just the particle momentum. Here is the particles total energy. That includes its rest mass energy. And strictly speaking, you should use relativistic. Equations for the momentum. Although for the problems we do m * V is perfectly fine most of the time. Remember the special relativity? The total energy of a particle is gamma and not C ^2. So that's what you would be plugging in there to get the frequency of this matter. We've we won't use that very much. Or at least we won't usually be asked what the frequency of matter waves are, but just remember that because obviously you usually see it as the energy of a photon. Mention the last lecture how this led to the more physical interpretation of. The Bohr model for hydrogen. And that this could be an integer number of debris, wave links. And this is a better figure than of what those standing waves. Look like. But when he proposed this. There was no evidence whatsoever to back this claim, and often in science, when someone comes up with a prediction like this, then falls onto the hands of experimentalists. To try and confirm that. So this was then the Daviston garmir experiment. Do you remember this from last year? Yeah, did I tell you what they were trying to do at the time last year? So this is also an interesting example of. When science discovers something. Because of an accident. In 1927, they showed that electron diffraction was consistent with debris. In this experimental setup. They were generating a beam of electrons. So remember the fermionic emission from an X ray tube. So you get very hot filament. The electrons gain energy. We get enough energy they can actually overcome the attractive forces inside the metal and they fly off just like water evaporating right. And then they put. This electron gun. Here is your cathode anode pair, not accelerates those electrons. To 54 EV. Using slits and things like that, you can make a monoenergetic beam of electrons, so they're all at 54 Ivy. And they hit this piece of nickel. And then they have an electron detector to measure what comes off as a function of angle. They were not looking for diffraction. They wanted to see how rough the surface of a crystal was. And their hypothesis was that even if it looked like a mirror finish, electrons are such small particles. That they would actually probe the very fine atomic structure of the surface and they would see are there undulations. What is the roughness? And it was a polycrystalline sample that they had remember in the lecture we talked about X ray diffraction. I said you can have powder diffraction. That's when you take a crystal and you grind it up. So it's lots of crystals, so polycrystalline. They had a simple mikulich that most metals that you just dig up out of the ground are going to be polycrystalline. This experiment had to be done in vacuum. Because these electrons are very low energy and they would collide with air molecules. If that wasn't the case. And because of the experiment set up the nickel. Could oxidase it was exposed to air. They accidentally did that. They wanted to get rid of the oxide layer so they heat up the piece of nickel. Very very hot and then let it cool down. What they didn't realize was that they created a single crystal of nickel. That's how you make crystals. And that's then why when they did the experiment, they saw this bright peak at 65 degrees. It was polycrystalline. They wouldn't see that, so it was an accident. Anyway. Bragg's law had already been known from X ray diffraction. As well as the spacing in the nickel. And when? They looked into that. They found there was a first order reflection. Remember the order. Refers to this thing and here don't confuse this with your quantum numbers, of course. At 1.65 angstroms. And the prices should be 1.67 angstroms. Why do you think there's a discrepancy there? They measured. Something corresponding 1.65. The price is 1.67. They concluded this was entirely consistent with Debroy. They said excellent agreement. I couldn't actually find any source telling me what the uncertainties in their measurement where. Which is bad bro. If he's doing labs this year, make sure to put uncertainties in any measurement you present IE. But in your report. But these were really good scientists, so they probably had quite a precise number. So this did not match this, but they said it was excellent agreement. Why do you think that was the case? When you account for an effect. This number changes and agrees perfectly. Yeah. No, not the uncertainty principle, but maybe that's included. That might have an effect in there. And how else? It's easier than that. He measured the wavelength of light inside a material. What we have linked would you have? Be the vacuum wavelength divided. By the refractive index. And crystals have a refractive index for electrons that behave like waves. Now it's not the same as the optical one. They have a refractive index, and when you compensate for that. These match perfectly, so that's the wavelength. The electrons in the material. So. We've got evidence that. Electrons can behave like waves and photons can believe behave like particles. And this is this phrase we have particle geology. There's no way around this, even though people at the time were very, very unsettled. By these predictions and these observations. More and more evidence was mounting that this is how nature works. So how do you get around it? For matter, you want to ask yourself what is it this actually waving? Does anyone know the answer to this? Good, because nobody knows the answer to this. This is still a matter of very active debate. In quantum mechanics. And philosophy as a whole. We'll see eventually that. One school of thought is to not even care about what is actually waving, and this free is just shut up and calculate. It was coined by David Mermin, famous physicist who said stop wasting time thinking about the philosophy. You've got the theory. Just use it and it's been very successful. Everyone's got a mobile phone. Quantum mechanics give us those. But Bourne will see in the next slide. Uhm? He did try to tackle this question and then try and answer this. We then get to something that is useful. A good place to start is to look at electromagnetic waves, just like Debroy. And his belief that there was a symmetry in nature. Let's start there and see if it gives us any insights. 2. What might be waving for a matter wave? So if you have an electromagnet, we have probably getting along the X axis, so something like this. We saw last year. You might describe that as a planewave. And a planewave. So at this point here, the electric field. These are vectors, remember? N This would be. And the Y axis I remember right? Or at that point, but it would point in that direction. Is sign. K X minus Omega T. This is a function of justice X. But a plan with defines. This electric field at all values in space. If you want to think about it at anytime and exposition, it is defining a plane. That is infinite. And Y&Z. Now that's probably not a very realistic representation, and we know that that's not highlight behaves. But it can be a good approximation, just like we saw with black body. And we said, let's do a 1D cavity, even though it's not real. Maybe you can use the insights we gain there to help explain. More realistic behavior. So we do a similar thing with plane waves. They knew at the time that in the way of picture. The intensity of electromagnetic wave was proportional to the electric field squared hands up. If you saw that last year. OK, kids that wasn't last year. Did you see a thing called the Poynting vector last year? Now you'll see that this year. Basically just telling you what the intensity from dramatic wave is and where it's going to be for. In terms of photons. The intensity. Which is energy and in this context per unit volume. Well, in terms of. Photons. We can say this is an gamma HF, where N gamma is the number of photons per unit volume. You've got those. You will apply it BHF you get the energy per unit flight. To try and unite the wave and particle models for Nitro magnetic wave, Einstein said well, why not just set these things and equal to each other? So the amplitude of an E field squared? As proportional to. Density of the photons. No Max born comes along and says well, what's the cemetery for matter with? Now you're going to associate more than just a simple wavelength from frequency of a matter wave. By using a wave function should say this is in general because then in a second I'm going to say a single frequency, right? But in general you associate with matter. We have a thing called the wave function. And this Greek letter PSI on upper case and lower case represents that. And that's going to represent the particle. And if it's moving in the X direction. It'll have a precise value of momentum and energy associated with it. If we say it's a plane wave, let's just postulate that. So PSI of X t = a Cos KX minus Omega T. These look very similar. Born said then the magnitude of this squared. Which is sistar sigh. Someone shout out what size are say is it's on the slide to be further. Soci Starci sistars the complex conjugate. Let this thing here. Represent the probability density. The probability of finding a particle per unit volume. Einstein said the intensity is proportional number of photons per unit volume. That's kind of like the probability density. If you just divide it by the total number of photons in the universe, it is the probability density, right? For one day, this would be a probability per unit length, of course. Which is what we'll talk about and then start. You'll do 2D and 3D, so probably through an area per unit volume. And even a site as a complex function which will see it generally is. The probability density is a real positive value. Nobody knows what you should physically say Cy itself as. That's the shut up and calculate school for some people. Think about it. Many worlds interpretations. Copenhagen interpretation things like that. What we can only do is give the probability of locating a particle in space. We can't say exactly where it is, and that's what we'll see shortly. Before moving on though. Someone needs to show what the complex conjugate is. So if I have a complex number Z. Let's say it's equal to X + y, Y. What's the complex conjugate? This definitely was in first year mouse. So what do you say right here? Yeah, I think it was up in the back as well, so X minus. I why it's probably the most pretentious named. Thing in all of marv's, you just flip the sign if the imaginary part right. That's all you do. Now for the magnitude of Z. You could. Draw the complex number. So this is your real access, your imaginary or your eye access. Some people might say, and you could represent a complex number. This is X. This is why. And AB squared is equal to X ^2 + y ^2. Magnitude is that squared, right? The complex conjugate. So sad, star Z is equal to. X minus ay. Times X + y Y. X ^2 -- y Y X + y Y X. Uhm? Minus I ^2 y ^2. These knock each other out. Says stars add equals less happy days and equals this. Right, so why bother with complex conjugate? Why do you think we need to use the complex conjugate? When they give the same result. For the magnitude. Yeah, so I'll get rid of the imaginary part. Arguably this is kind of doing that as well. I guess you just need to remember to separate this thing. You always need to separate obviously into real and imaginary components. When we come to do shrodinger proper. We're going to see things like this. OK. If we just wrote magnitude of sign here. These things wouldn't work. On the order here matters as well, by the way, so it's I star sign, not science. I sorry, I know this is a bit prescriptive maybe. But that's the way it is. Few people are looking at this weird. Does anyone know what this will give you? Or rather, if you do that. It's the operator for possession, which you'll get to learn all about next week. OK, so. From this day on site, Starsci. Last year it was the magnitude of PSI squared. Alright, where's me? Thank you. So now the wavefunction. It's called a plane wave. It's also called a harmonic wave. In this context, that's just a wave with a single frequency. Goes forever in time or space. What is the probability density corresponding to this wavefunction? Now we said it can be complex, and indeed it usually is. We can say equivalently. This wavefunction here can be represented by this. I've put a star on here. I put it in here for Euler's formula. Which, if you remember, is E to the IE theater is equal to Cos Theta plus a same theater. Stars in there for another reason. There's a pitfall here that's something you've got to watch out for. I've said quite a few times. It's one of the boards that you bang on about all the time. That context is key. Now in physics. At school you learn this is it? This is it. You never stray out of the way you word things. Now depending which textbook you read, notation might be different. Even definitions can vary. You need to be sure you understand what the context is and what someone is talking about. This is not equivalent to that, because we've gotten a sane feeder here. I have implicitly said this is equivalent to the real part of this. You see that a lot on electromagnetism. Do you know why this makes life easier? Once again, it's on the slide. So this exponential notation removes these signs and cosines. And in this example the downstairs. Well 8 VI. Theater, let's say. Times 8 the minus I theater. You multiply. With these indices it's the same. Then it's just adding them. Well, plus a. Plus minus I goes to zero. We just get a squared. And that's a constant. So this exponential notation simplifies the maps. It greatly simplifies the mouths when you're looking at differential equations. In quantum mechanics. We generally are going to be including the imaginary component of this. You need to be sure you understand which, so in electromagnetism they often mean. When they just say something like this. I'm talking about the real part here. We're going to be including both except for this example. OK. As they said, if you understood quantum mechanics, then you haven't. Probably because of stuff like this. The probability density of this plane wave comes out as constant. Irrespective of possession. So what's the total probability of finding a particle anywhere? Well. If I sum up the probability density over all space and it's a constant value everywhere I get Infinity. And that's not how particles behave. The probability of finding a particle in the universe is one if it exists at summer, right? So we're already seeing that a wave function or sorry a plane wave is probably a per representation. For a particle. And we'll do an example. They really hammer that home in a second. What we might then think about instead our way of packets. So we have packet as a pulse. And it could look something like this. Or it could look something like this, moving along a rope in this case in this direction. This is localized in time and space just like particles. So maybe we have functions are better represented by wavepackets. Maybe plane waves do a better job at describing the velocity. Of a particle. So let's see. If that is the case. So. What time is it? Just want to take a wee minute just to chat. Take a break 'cause I know these lectures are long right? And I'll put a few things on the board, and then I'll come back to you and answer the questions I'm asking so we can get through things quick, OK? Right? Second, OK. So. Hopefully that charge people up a bit more. So we're going to try and show that a plane wave is rubbish, so this example is going to show that a plane wave rubbish. We want to see what the velocity. Of a plane we have is that represents a particle. The fears velocity for any way of his own way over K. For a plane wave, this equals the grip velocity. And the group velocity is what we're going to be interested in, but it's easier to do it this way for this plane wave, right? Or in fact, group velocity, really. For plane wave might not even be a valid thing to say. Actually, 'cause remember, grip velocity is what the envelope moves at, so that pulse that we saw a second ago. What the pulse moves out. This is only over K and I want to try and convert this into quantities that relate to matter with, so I'm going to use the Einstein Debroy relations. Equals HF and Lambda equals extra P. I need to go from these wave quantities. These matter or particle quantities or matter wave companies. So you use Omega equals 2\u03c0 F. Lambda equals 2\u03c0, /, K. And I can substitute and then. So I get E equals H bar Omega. And K. Equals 2. Yep, 2\u03c0, Oh yeah, sorry. I should have said 2\u03c0 / H which is equal to P / X bar. Everyone happy with H bar being H / 2\u03c0. So there is just Planck's constant hands up. If you're happy with that. Perfect. So now you've got an expiration for Omega in terms of V. Unfar K in terms of P. So now I substitute this N VP is equal to. Over edge bar. Times H bar over P and he's not each other out and get over P. Now I'm going to assume that my particle is non relativistic. If this is a good description for Planewave, as it did good description. For modern wave it should work for nonrelativistic and relativistic, right? So E. It is just the kinetic energy. I've put that up on the board. So he is just the kinetic energy. Which I can express. In terms of the momentum. On the mass. So my feasible osity is equal to P. ^2. All over two AM P. He's knocking each other right and I get pee all over 2M. Well, for non relativistic the momentum is just the mass times the velocity. So this is M V. All over 2M. The masses no cancel. And we're left with V / 2 well, what's V here? That's the particle velocity. We've started with the assumption. That a way of is a good representation of a particle. That the Einstein Debroy relations hold. And we've lead to a contradiction. The wave travels at half the velocity. Of the particle. This is clearly not a good description. What do you think happens if you include relativity here? You don't make this assumption. Fierce velocity is faster than the speed of light. We know that particles cannot travel faster than the speed of light, or even at the speed of light. At least they have mass, right? So clearly this is a bad description of a matter wave. So it looks like we're forced. To go to the wave particle we have packet description. So now we use the grip velocity. And the group of all group velocity is D Omega. By decay the rate of change of the angular frequency. With wave number right? We know from here. Omega Z / X bar. So I could just say then. D Omega is d / H bar. He's happy with this step. What have I done? Going from here to here, what have I done? People put their hands up. They say they were happy with it. I just put these in front of things, don't I? Of course not right. What have we done in this step? You'll see textbooks. Skip this out all the time. I need the rate of change of D Omega here with respect to decay. And this equation if I differentiate. So day by D. So differentiate with respect to energy. This equation. He over edge bar I get one over X bar. But that's equal to D. Omega by D. Yeah, DVD of this equals D by D, is this? And then I just bring this D up to here. So I have differentiated this with respect to energy, then brought the D up. So I have the Omega. Equals D or X bar. I have K. K = P / X bar and do the same thing. Differentiate with respect to momentum so I get decay equals DP over X bar. And now I sub these two ends of the group velocity so you get VG equals. DEAH bar divided by fraction. Turn upside down. Multiply. The H Bars Council again and I get VG equals D. ADP kind of similar to what we end up here, right? Now I'm going to assume relativity. Turns out it makes it easier to do it for this one. Well, if I want the plug in. I'm sorry I've skipped this step. So relativistic total energy E squared is equal to P ^2 C ^2 plus. I am not C ^2. All squared. I need to find something. The eBay DP. I've got energy, got momentum, so if I differentiate this with respect to probably get it, how do I differentiate something like this? To get the BP. So I use implicit differentiation. So D by D. Of e ^2 * d by DP. Will get me. The different derivative with respect to momentum of this side. So remember implicit differentiation is basically just going along using the chain rule as you go. So that's 2E. To eBay DP. I've done DDP and this says side. So I have to do it on this side. And I get 2PC squared and this disappears. So the EIDP equals. PC squared all over. This is what I'm after. I know plug in. My total energy comma. I'm not C squared and my relativistic momentum. And I get Gamma am not V C squared divided by gamma. Am not C squared and everything cancels here. Except the. So a grip, sorry not Group A wave packet, propagates at a group velocity equal to the particle velocity. So this looks like we're on the right lines. You need to be able to do this moves for quantum mechanics. And if you just fired in days and the last thing. You wouldn't get the right answer, so you need to know things like implicit differentiation and steps like this. You're actually taking derivatives. OK. That slide was just what we did there. Any questions on that? We're not going to finish all of this lecture today. I think maybe we'll we'll see, but we can always run into tomorrow. So. No more worked examples. I'm going to talk a little bit now. How you make these wavepackets in the first place? So. We've pack, it looks like the way to go. But how do you actually make this? So you've seen in 1004? That when you get 111, sorry when you get two waves of slightly different frequencies. And some of them together. You get a beat pattern and you've all experienced this. Hands up, who's heard the beating on a plane when the engines are running. So if the engines are both turning, actually go that way, right? They go the same way. If they're turning at slightly different speeds, you get like a hum that beats like that. The Penguin reference. Penguins apparently aren't very good at. Recognizing each other visually. So they have two sort of vocal cords that make these slightly different frequencies and then produce a unique beat pattern so they find each other be listening and that's how Penguins can find each other. When you add these two waves you get something like this. There is an Excel spreadsheet which I will upload after this. For you to play with. See what these beets look like? So you do something like that and you get a big pattern. I really recommend. That you go look at the spreadsheet, try and replicate it yourself. Plotting graphs and doing spreadsheets. What scientists do? You may not use Excel and make you something about soccer, but. That's what you're going to be doing. You're going to be doing it in labs. So why not get some practice in? There's an interesting video list. I think it's interesting. Which is a pretty low bar to be fair, but there's an interesting video here of someone showing beat waves between tuning forks. So you take two tuning forks that are synchronized or in tune with each other. And you put one in an ice bucket and the other one in a Bunsen burner. The guy doing this is insufferable by the way. If anyone watches this OK. Why do you think when you put the tuning forks in the ice water or in the Bunsen burner the frequency changes? For COVID, I brought chocolate bars these things for people answering questions. Sorry. And what would that do? But why? What would be the key parameter that would change the frequency? Give you some later pendulum. Remember. So longer. Yes, yeah, I think so. The masks make it hard to hear people. The length of the times. That's what these things are called in. A tuning fork dictates the frequency to a large extent. You also have things like the density and the stiffness of the material, which in physics would be summed up in the Youngs modulus. But check it out, I think it's somewhat interesting. How people right? So that's how you get a beat with. But what if you keep adding in more waves? So an iceberg figure 39 on Tipler on ashamedly just mix this in that textbook as well. Well, I should have said boy and Templar. I'm always referring to the 5th edition. There's two additions in the labor anyway. If the superposition of seven waves and you get know this more complex looking pulse. Of course, as periodic because with seven waves it doesn't take very long. These are all integer multiples by the way of the frequency. It doesn't take very long for these things to sync up again, so you get a repeating. In that Excel spreadsheet. I've also made a sheet. For wavepackets. So you can go in here and you can change DF so the frequency difference. And see how these things change around. If you like using something like MATLAB, you can go in and add up. Thousands of waves and see what it looks like. If you don't like something like MATLAB. You can also use this demo so it's linked from the slide. And in this year they use a furry analysis. Either further series or we'll see in a second transform to some together more and more harmonics. Remember the harmonics or just those pure sinusoidal waves? All the waves are in phase at X = 0 and t = 0. It doesn't have to be the case, by the way. That's where you get this thing getting smaller anyway. When you have an infinite number of harmonics. Your series becomes a very integral. Don't worry if you don't understand these things right now. OK, you don't need to. You come across the mouse. We get a continuous distribution and this periodicity will disappear. So let's see if we can show you that. So when you click into this Tamil it take awhile to load up runs in Java but it's got some sort of web based Java so you have to download anything. I'm not sure how much longer it'll work for though. Nope, that's not on the screen. So when you click into it, you want to click this tab. Discrete to continuous. And as you bring this down, let me get rid of this here. You can see here if I zoom out. We've still got discrete harmonics, and you see that pulsing reappearing. This is a further series, so it's the discrete. Some of these functions. And then if I click this to make the spacing between the components 0. You know you get a pulse. If I change the web, this is the distribution of the harmonics. So how many waves you're adding together and their amplitudes vary as well. They changed the word for those. And make them broader. I can generate a shorter pulse. I cannot have both of these things simultaneously very narrow. That leads to the classical uncertainty relationship. So Delta X delta K about one or delta Omega delta T. Well, leave it there have a play with this stuff and we're going to be talking about this more tomorrow, OK?", "title": " Lecture 5 PHY2021-22  De Broglie Wavelength and Wavepackets ", "lecturer": "Steven White", "date": "Published on 9/30/2021 by  Steven White ", "description": ""}, {"ID": 2, "url": "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/60a76609-f61a-42d6-aa20-77431b931344", "type": "video", "content": "Hello and welcome to the statistical mechanics part of PHY 2001. I'm short SIM and I'm going to be your lecturer for this part of the module which will last approximately 4 weeks. So what is statistical mechanics? Well, statistical mechanics is the best piece of physics. Why do I say that? Well, I've got sort of two lines of argument that I would like to put to you. First of all, statistical mechanics crops up all over the place in our study of physics. I myself, I'm a theoretical astrophysicist. My primary research interest is in the study of supernova explosions, and I run computer simulations to investigate. That, but I make use of statistical mechanics all of the time. So many of the key results that we will derive and explore and and and make use of in the course of this module are fundamental to the to the research work that I do myself. And I'm certainly not alone in that. I'm across many branches of physics. Work depends on a sound understanding of statistical mechanics. So in particular, colleagues working on solid state physics working in plasma physics and a wide range of sub branches. Of theoretical physics depend on sound understanding of statistical mechanics, so it's a very universal theory that has a very broad range of applications, and for that reason I think is extremely important. Secondly, uhm, I really like statistical mechanics because of the type of problem. It allows us to answer so already in this module and the first part of this module you've been studying quantum mechanics and that is mostly so far being studied in the context of considering single particles. So for example, you've studied problems a bit like this, so this box is something like a quantum welfare representation. So you've studied the quantum mechanical problem of having a single particle that is trapped inside a potential well confined inside some volume, and so you've studied the very elegant and beautiful quantum mechanical problem of a single particle trapped inside a volume, and from that first part of the module you should have a good understanding of how you can solve this reading or equation how that can lead to the allowed states of the particle, the energy levels, and so on. In the context of a single particle being trapped inside the box, and that is a beautiful and extremely important physics problem. However, if I really consider a system like this box which is full of air, there's of course not one particle trapped inside this box, but billions upon billions upon billions upon billions of particles trapped inside this box, and that being the case, from what you know about studying single particles. So single particle systems, whether quantum mechanical or classical mechanics, or in classical mechanics. It might seem like this problem should be almost in conceivably complicated and conceivably difficult to to make any progress on, because if it's studying, one particle sounds complicated. You know, if you've got however many billions there are in here, the chances of being able to find an elegant simple theory that describes such a system may seem almost insurmountable. However, we know that that's not true. We know that there are well described simple theories that actually provide a very elegant. Understanding of a system like this, and so we know that properties of systems like gases or particles trapped in volumes actually obey rather simple behaviors. So here is the ideal gas law, which is not a bad approximation for a system like air trapped inside a box. As I just showed you. So there are rather simple behaviors whereby in this case the pressure, the volume, and the temperature of of a system of gas particles are actually all interrelated in a very simple way, depending also on the. Total number of particles in the system and it's understanding this connection. How we go from what sounds like it should be a phenomenally complicated problem. Of all these billions upon billions of particles, zooming around, all having their own little adventures inside the the trapped volume. How from that this sort of simplicity nevertheless emerges how it is that despite the vast number of particles being involved, that we can actually have a fairly simple description of things like thermodynamics. Of systems of gases and other populations of particles, so I think that's a really, really interesting and really, really important branch of physics. Understanding how we go from the microscopic behavior of individual particles to the collective behavior or the OR the the the behavior of of of systems that is nevertheless comprehensible, and that is very much what statistical mechanics is all about, and the theory for that is what we will be developing over the next few weeks. So my approach to to this material will be to present it primarily via our timetabled lectures supported by a range of resources that will be up on the canvas page. Now, unfortunately, we do only have a relatively short amount of time, so I'm sorry to say that we won't be able to go into all of the details. We might like to around this topic, and so I will be focusing this part of part of the course on on conveying the principles. Or statistical mechanics and applying those to some relatively simple but nevertheless important, UM examples. The course will be structured into five sections, each of which we will work through at the lectures, and each of which will be supported by a set of notes and some other resource is that will be being made available to you through the canvas page as we progress. Uhm, now as part of this the introduction, I want to draw your attention to some of those particular resources that are already available on the canvas page. That may be particularly useful to you, and may in particular be useful to you right at the very start, as we're getting familiar with the content, and so these are various documents that are already available in canvas and can be accessed from the the front of my canvas pages on the statistical mechanics section. So I'm just gonna spend a few moments drawing your attention to these, and if you're watching this video on the front page of the canvas, these will all be from links somewhere down below on this same page. So the first of these documents, UM, is what I've got here, which hopefully I'm I'm sharing now see so you can see so I've I've prepared this UM list of the notation that we'll be using through this course. So because this course spans a wide range of different pieces of physics, both from microscopic and macroscopic POV, we will encounter quite a range of different physical conditions and physical variables. As we proceed, So what this document tries to do is provide summary of the notation I'll be using throughout this. This piece of the course, so you may find it useful to have a look through that or be familiar with that so that particular were developing and the mathematical parts if there's any ambiguity or any confusion over what notation means, this will hopefully be a useful sort of look up documents to help with that. The second document that I've got linked that I want to draw your attention to as well is this one. UM, so this is a a document that talks about some mathematics that we all make use of. Now this is not core mathematics for this module. The content of this document is not something I expect you to memorize or even necessarily be super familiar with, but this is just background. When we come onto particular parts of of of the course, in particular, we studied the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution. We will need to make use of some standard integral relations and what this document is here to do is to provide a little bit of context and background on how to do those integrals that we will need at a later stage. So just to re emphasize, I don't expect you to go and memorize and commit a rigorous sort of. A cross check of this this document, but it's here to help you if you want to understand how to do some of the integrals that we will come across later in the course, and there's some interesting neat little mathematical tricks for how to do these so that may be something you wish to review at some point. It's only a couple of pages long. UM, the the last of these that I want to draw attention to at the moment, which is also the most important, is this one. So this is a document that reviews some key background information that we will need going into this module. So this module does draw on some important results from mathematics and also from physics that we will use at various stages as we go along, particularly in section one, but also in some of the later sections we will draw on some important results to do with counting. Theory in in mathematics, and in particular this thing called the multinomial theorem, will also make use of something called Stirling's approximation, which is described in this document as well, and we will be quite dependent at some stages on having a thorough understanding and being comfortable with the use of partial derivatives and partial differentiation. So those are topics that particularly differentiation, that you will hopefully have plenty of practice. In from first year mathematics, but it's a good idea to make sure you're familiar with this and revise those topics and so this document sort of summarizes the particular things we're likely to to need. There are also some key results from fundamental physics that we will we will draw upon, which are summarized in this document as well. Most of this is material from first year physics, so some basic thermodynamics, some basic properties of gases and also magnetic properties of solids that have been discussed in the first year physics module and. Of particular relevance or particular importance is that we will also be making use of some of the results covered already in this module this year, but the second year quantum mechanics module, and so there's a summary here of what the key points for that would be as well, so it's important to have a review of those. So those three documents are available on the canvas page for you to take a take a look at. I will say a little bit about them at the the classes as well. I would also point out that particularly for that last document I have got a couple of videos recorded that that discuss the topics covered on that background sheet in a bit more detail. Those videos should also be linked from the front page of canvas, and so you may want to watch those to get a. Review of some of those key topics which, UM, the familiarity with them, should help you. Make sure that you can. You can be comfortable with the material as we cover it in the main course. OK, so it's everything I wanted to say for this introductory video, except to reiterate welcome statistical mechanics. I'm really looking forward to teaching this course I. I genuinely, really think this is a fantastic topic. I hope you find it interesting too, and I will be looking forward to seeing you at the classes. OK, thank you very much.", "title": " Statistical Mechanics Introduction ", "lecturer": "Stuart Sim", "date": "Published on 11/4/2021 by  Stuart Sim ", "description": "General introduction video for the Statistical Mechanics section of PHY2001."}]
